/*
Scenario: You want a program that outputs state names in reverse order to the order in which they were stored. 
So the last state name in the array will be output first, etc.
Create a new form named 'forReverseStates'.
Create an array named 'states'  that holds this data:

Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Use a 'for' loop to output one state at a time on its' own line, to the console in reverse order from the order they are in the array - so the first line shows the last state in the array, then the second line shows the second to last state in the array, etc. until the last state output will be the one that was first in the array.  There are several ways to do this - choose any one.
Use this format:

Texas
Oklahoma
North Dakota
South Dakota
etc.

/*
states = ["Nebraska", "Iowa", "Minnesota", "South Dakota", "North Dakota", "Kansas", "Oklahoma", "Texas"]
size = states.length
for (i = size-1; i >= 0; i--)
  console.log(`${states[i]}`)
